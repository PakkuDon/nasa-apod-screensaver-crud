# NASA API - Astronomy Picture Of the Day

Today you are going to be working with NASA's API to fetch and display their astronomy imagery. You are going to use this to create a screensaver.

You will first need an **API KEY**: https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key

You will then pull images using this **API**: https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#apod

By specifying the query parameter **date**, pull down via Ajax a series of images, e.g. 1 image per week (hint: MomentJS helps with changing date objects)

Create a CRUD app to store what you get from the API into a database.

Create a view in your CRUD app to display the images as a screensaver by attaching the images as background images.

Make your screensaver nicer by utilising css transitions/animations & transforms to switch between images.
